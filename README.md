Python 3.11.4
Run with pytest:
  pytest test_mail.py

Note:
  Unfortunately, I did not have much time to work on these and they are very incomplete.
  I wrote the notes as if I were going to test from the UI, but I wrote the tests in python so more like a backend test.
  I didn't get through all of the test cases either, but hopefully there's enough here that you can get an idea of how I work.
